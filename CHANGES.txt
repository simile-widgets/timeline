Version 2.1.0

* Event attribute classname is added to the classnames for the event's label
  and tape divs. Eg classname of 'hot_event' will result in div classes of
  'timeline-event-label hot_event' and 'timeline-event-tape hot_event' for
  the event's Timeline label and tape, respectively. Change is that classname
  is now added to the tape's div. -- Larryk rev 1576
* Re-worked function Timeline.DefaultEventSource.Event in sources.js to use
  named arguments (via a hash/anon object) rather than positional arguments.
  19 positional arguments are too many! Now much easier and cleaner to add
  additional event attributes.  -- Larryk rev 1576
* New event attribute eventID is a 'cookie' attribute that is stored, not used
  by the Timeline library. If you write a custom labeller or event bubble
  filler, the attribute can be obtained using the getEventID() method on the
  event object.  -- Larryk rev 1576
* New event attribute caption superceedes hoverText. hoverText is deprecated.
  For now, it will live on for backwards compatibility.  -- Larryk rev 1576
* Event attributes barImage and barRepeat renamed to tapeImage and tapeRepeat.
  No backwards compatibility. (Breaking change from previous checkin)
   -- Larryk rev 1576
* Fix: Event color attribute now properly sets the background color of the bar.
  Note that events (where isDuration = true) have opacity applied. See 
  http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/wiki/Timeline_EventSources (LarryK) rev 1569
* New event attribute barImage sets the event's bar div background-image.
  New event attribute barRepeat sets the background-repeat. Default is 'repeat'
  Cubism example updated to demonstrate color, textColor, barImage, barRepeat and
  hoverText attributes. For a handy stripe generator, see
  http://www.stripegenerator.com (LarryK) rev 1569
* Fix: Event attribute hoverText was not properly processed by JSON or SPARCL sources
  (LarryK) rev 1569
* Build process now creates timeline_source.zip which has source, examples and the
  jetty web server. Enables easy access with for folks without svn. (LarryK) rev 1569

  (LarryK) rev 1560
* Added forceLocale parameter to timeline-api.js to force a locale for testing
  (LarryK) rev 1560

* Added mouse-wheel scroll. Mouse-wheel acts as left and right arrow keys. Theme
  controls whether the mouse-wheel scrolls, zooms or moves the page (if the page
  has a scroll-bar). Docs: see webapp/docs/create-timelines.html
  (LarryK) rev 1553
* Additional support in timeline-api for using your own server for Timeline
  libraries (LarryK) rev 1553
* Separation of javascript and css (gm.marko) rev 1326
* Added mouse-wheel zoom functionality. It operates on a per-band basis, keeping
  the date under the mouse cursor static while the timeline around it scales. 
  Zoom is specified as user-defined steps. Documentation and a working demo in 
  the webapp/docs/create-timelines.html page (halcyon1981) rev 1418
* Added support for 'hoverText' - title pop-ups on Exhibit-based timelines
