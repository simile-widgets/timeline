  What is this?
  -------------

  Timeline is a web widget for visualizing temporal data.


  Installing Timeline
  -------------------

  Timeline consists entirely of static files (javascript libraries,
  image files and css files). All you really need is to
  serve the files contained in this package off a web server without 
  having to install any special server side functionality: the software
  is all executed in the browser.
  
  So, simply copy the files contained in this package to a location
  that is served by your web browser, making sure to keep the files
  in the same folder structure and you're done.

  
  How do I use Timeline?
  ----------------------
  
  For the impatient, read the comments inside "timeline-api.js" that will
  get you started.
  
  If you want to know more, refer to the Timeline documentation at
