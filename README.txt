  What is this?
  -------------

  Timeline is a DHTML-based AJAXy timeline.



  Running Timeline
  ----------------

  Timeline consists of a bunch of static resources. All you really need is to
  serve those resources off a web server. But we have configured the timeline
  project to be runnable Jetty, so if you have a java virtual machine 
  installed you can simply type "run" in your shell or in your command prompt.
  


  How do I customize Timeline?
  ----------------------------

  Refer to the Timeline web site at
