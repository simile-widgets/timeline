  What is this?
  -------------

  Timeline is a DHTML-based AJAXy timeline.



  Running Timeline
  ----------------

  Timeline consists of a bunch of static resources. All you really need is to
  serve those resources off a web server. But we have configured the timeline
  project to be runnable by Maven on top of Jetty, so if you have Maven you
  can run change to this directory (where this README.txt file resides) and
  run:
  
    maven jetty6:run



  How do I customize Timeline?
  ----------------------------

  Refer to the docs directory.



  Licensing and legal issues
  --------------------------

  Timeline is open source software and are licensed under the BSD license
  located in the LICENSE.txt file located in the same directory as this very file
  you are reading.
