Version 2.3.0 -- March 5, 2009

  New Features
  * AutoWidth. AutoWidth automatically calculates and sets the 'width' for 
    the Timeline's bands and for the overall Timeline. The 'width,' for horizontal
    Timelines, is actually the 'height' style of the various divs.
    
    The needed width is re-calculated whenever a new set of events
    are viewed or are about to be viewed. If the new needed width is greater than the
    current width, the increase is animated. See the example.
    
    To use autoWidth:
    1) You will be modifying the theme's settings in your html file. 
    2) Set the theme's autoWidth to true
    3) Optionally update the theme's autoWidthAnimationTime setting.
    4) Optionally update the autoWidthMargin settings in the Theme. The margin, per
       band, is used to set how close the bottom of the lowest track is to the 
       edge of the band's div. The units are total track width. There are two settings,
       one for overview bands, the second for others.
    5) After you have loaded your events, call tl.finishedEventLoading() where tl is the 
       Timeline object returned from Timeline.create. 
    Demo: examples/test_example2/test_example2.html
    
  * Timeline start and end feature. Timelines are still infinite by default, but you can
    now add a start and end. Add theme.timeline_start, theme.timeline_stop to disable
    movement of the Timeline beyond the start and/or stop. 
    The setting affects the entire Timeline and must be set in the theme of the
    first band. Note: Depending on the relative resolutions of the bands, different
    amounts of the various bands will be seen when at a start or stop edge, depending
    on which band was being moved and by how much. In addition to setting the timeline_start
    and _stop, you may want to add span decorators to cover up the 
    unused parts of the Timeline. See example2. A Timeline will not be movable
    past a start/stop edge but it can be initially loaded beyond the edges by using
    the date parameter of the Band Info.

  * Added CompactPainter, which allows for large images and can render
    image stacks. See the new compact-painter example.

  * Highlighting event labels: When highlighting events on a Timeline, default is to
    highlight the event's icon or tape. If theme.event.highlightLabelBackground is true,
    the label's background will also be changed to the highlight color.
    See the Jewish timeline example: type a highlight match term in a highlight box.

  * Use new maxHeight param from SimileAjax for setting maxHeight of 
    bubbles. Added theme.bubble.maxHeight with default of 0 (no maximum).

 
  Developer features and changes
  * Upgraded to jQuery 1.2.6 minimized file
  * Changed timeline-api to use MIT Simile Ajax v 2.2.0. by default.
  * New feature tests and demonstrations of features added to test_examples.
    See the examples directory.  
  * Per event css classnames. Double class name selectors don't work on 
    IE so now add context specific prefixes to css classname supplied with an
    event's definition. Eg if an event has classname attribute 'hot' then 
    original-painter label divs will have class="hot label-hot timeline-event-label"
    icon element will have icon-hot and hot, tapes will have tape-hot and hot.
    Additional prefixes: highlight- for event-highlight,
    small- for overview painter.
  * Added tags/latest, a copy of the latest tagged release. Will be used for
    referring to examples and other source files from the wiki.
  * Event tape heights now use theme.event.tape.height.
  * Bullet-proofing: Fix for issue 34. If an event's dates don't make sense then
    the library will replace the event's label with an error message. Eg 
    latestStart date after the event's earliestEnd. Or End before Start, etc.
  * Issue (RFE) 26: Added event attribute trackNum for developers to specify
    a track number instead of using automatic layout.
  * Add English day names to en locale
  * Add formated ids to event tapes, labels, icons to
    enable a single listener to retrieve state from the id. Added support functions
    event-utils.js.
  * Added EventPaintListener hook to original-painter. Enables clients to hook into
    painting life cycle. See original-painter.js.
  * Added  track.offset setting to original-painter. Enables specific
    control over top margin of band event painting. Very useful when a
    Timeline has multiple event bands or a pseudo event band that is just
    used for labeling above an event band.  -- LarryK rev 1661
  * Added instant.impreciseIconMargin to original-painter. Enables specific
    control over top margin of icon (margin between bottom of tape and 
    top of icon). Only used if the event has a tape and an icon.
  * Span decorator improvements: now can have null labels. New param of 
    inFront. If true, then the span is in front of all layers but the events.
    Now uses color attribute if present, else css. -- LarryK rev 1677
  * Span point decorator: Now uses color attribute if present, else css.
  * When you run run.bat, we now serve
    http://localhost:9999/ajax/api - from src/webapp/ajax/api/
    http://localhost:9999/timeline - from src/webapp/
    http://localhost:9999/timeline/api - from src/webapp/timeline/api/
  * PointHighlightDecorator now uses the width parameter, not CSS.
  * Issue (RFE) 60: Added Timeline.version string in timeline.js.
    Added Timeline.writeVersion -- a helper that writes out the 
    current version. Updated examples to use it.
  * Fixed overview painter to use event's classname attribute if present.

      
  Bug fixes
  * Issue 13: Event labels wrap on FF 3 on Mac.
  * Issue 16: Tape color for overview painter now set correctly. Uses event's color
    attribute, theme.event.duration.color or css color for class timeline-small-event-tape.
  * Issue 20: Fixed issues caused when events don't have title attribute.
  * Issue 30: Event labels wrap when 'classname' attribute is added and text is bold. 
  * Issue 31: added event's classname attribute to div for icons too.
  * Issue 33: added event attribute durationEvent. 
  * Event highlighting now working again.
