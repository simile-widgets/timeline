      JSTOR engineers notice an extremely large number of requests for
      downloads originating from MIT.  They observe 450,000 articles from
      560 journals downloaded during this period.

      The Class C network within MIT's allocation is blocked by JSTOR from
      accessing its resources.  Access is restored after discussion between
      MIT Libraries and JSTOR resolves that an unknown network visitor was
      responsible and unlikely to return.

      In response to the second attack, JSTOR blocks an entire Class A

      Swartz initiates a less obvious, long-running download job by setting
      up his laptop and a disk drive in an MIT infrastructure closet.  JSTOR
      catches on to this attempt a month later and discovers it resulted in
      obtaining 4.3 million articles.  Swartz has made about 4.8 million
      downloads in total, about 80% of JSTOR's database.

      JSTOR engineers contact MIT over email and request assistance,
      having potentially discovered where on campus the much larger
      download came from.  They try twice but fail to reach anybody
      as all but a skeleton crew are on furlough at the end of the year.

      MIT IS&amp;T network engineers try to find the exact location of

      later officers arrive and are posted in the hallway.  At the same time,
      network engineer staff connect to the same switch to observe network
      traffic flowing to the laptop.  Photographs are taken; the MIT Police

      Someone stops by, with a bike helmet covering his face, to
      remove the laptop and hard drive, taking them with as he
      departs.  The person responsible for monitoring the status
      of the network port is not on campus but notifies co-workers
      and police that the laptop is disconnected.  They arrive too
      late to the closet to apprehend him.  However, they note that

      "Very early in this post-arrest preiod, MIT decided to 'remian
      neutral,' as between the government and Aaaron Swartz, in the
      investigation and eventual prosecution.  Initially this meant
      simply that MIT would not take a public position on the prosecution.
      Throughout the following (almost) two years, MITâ€™s decisions were
      mostly guided by this posture of neutrality." - page 52 (time imprecise)

      Before these events, JSTOR and MIT were in talks to increase barriers
      to access JSTOR content.  The efforts were expedited and put into place
      not long after Swartz is arrested.  JSTOR can only be accessed from
      certain workstations in the libraries.

      Swartz turns over his copy of the JSTOR data, assuring that there
      are no other copies in existence and none to be released to the
      public.  With that assurance, JSTOR drops any further pursuit of
      civil charges.  In addition, Swartz paid $26,500 to JSTOR, $1,500
      for damages, and $25,000 for attorneys' fees and costs.

      During a phone call with the lead prosecutor, the OGC is informed
      of the state of the investigation, which is that an indictment might
      come down based on the prosecutor's supervisors' decision of how
      to proceed.  His stance is to give MIT information as it pertains
      and arrives.  MIT concludes that MIT's opinions were unlikely to have
      an effect on the prosecution as their views appeared to have already
      been taken into account.  Also, if JSTOR considered the matter closed
      and yet prosecution was proceeding, MIT's opinions would have no
      impact either.
