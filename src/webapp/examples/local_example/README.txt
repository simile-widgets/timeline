                          Local Timeline
                          --------------
                        
                        
This example show how to load a timeline from a local data file.

This trick enables us to read the local data file without needing to run
any sort of web server.

Installation
------------

Install this directory of files anywhere on your computer.
You do need internet access.
No local web server is needed, Timeline library is loaded directly from
the web.

Running
-------

Open your web browser, then open the local_example.html file.

  Instructions for specific browsers:
  
  * Internet Explorer
    a) File / Open...   menu option
    b) Press [Browse] and navigate to the local_example.html file
    
  * Firefox, Safari
    a)File / Open File...  menu option
    b) Then navigate to the local_example.html file
    
  * Chrome: Doesn't seem to offer a file open option. 
    You can enter a file url specification of 
    file:///C:/something / something /local_example/local_example.html
    but that's not so convenient.

You should then see the Timeline displayed in your browser.
You will need access to the internet to enable your browser to load the 
Timeline library from the server.
